- The `src/` directory contains the Python modules for preprocessing the data (`preprocessing.py`), training the model (`model.py`), evaluating the model (`evaluation.py`), and generating dummy data (`generatedata.py`).
- The `reports/` directory contains the project report in PDF format (`project_report.pdf`).
- The `models/` directory stores the trained machine learning model (`trained_model.pkl`).
- The `docs/` directory includes the project documentation, including the `README.md` and `setup.md` files.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tonyloyt/mlopsProject.git

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Explore the dataset using the `exploratory_analysis.ipynb` notebook in the `notebooks/` directory.

4. Preprocess the data by running the `preprocessing.py` module in the `src/` directory.

5. Train the machine learning model using the `model.py` module.

6. Evaluate the trained model using the `evaluation.py` module.


## Results and Evaluation
The trained model can be evaluated using various metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). The evaluation.py module provides functions to calculate these metrics and visualize the true versus predicted values.

## Documentation
The docs/ directory contains the project documentation, including the README.md file for an overview of the project and the setup.md file for installation and setup instructions.

## Reports
The reports/ directory includes the project report in PDF format (project_report.pdf). It provides a detailed description of the project, methodology, and results.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of developing a machine learning model for housing price prediction. By following the steps outlined in the project structure, you can explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
